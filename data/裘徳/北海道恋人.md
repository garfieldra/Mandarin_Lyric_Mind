作曲：裘德

Just have a taste
of the wine we split
check if all escaped
things were sweet

We followed the path...of
runaway stars
to lights, bright lights
sadly shining

(Before) drinking up this bottle, shall we hold
Burning up these lights, parting's unfold

(Before) breaking up, shall we stay in hokkaido
freezing up the sentences I will be told

May I warm the frost
dwelling on your lips
check if all lost
things were soft

Who's cleared the mists
on the Mashu lake
We saw Antares
sadly shining

(Before) drinking up this bottle, shall we hold
Open up your eyes, parting's unfold

(Before) breaking up, shall we stay in hokkaido
freezing up the sentences I will be told

(Before) drinking up this bottle, shall we hold
Open up your eyes, parting's unfold

(Before) breaking up, shall we stay in hokkaido
freezing up the sentences I will be told
