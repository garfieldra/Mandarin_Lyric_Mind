Absolution
Sins are forgiven
When the ink was drained
I shall write a poem
With a pen of squid tonight

Transformation
Not a crime scene
Call it 'recipe'
Smoke or marinate
Why not roast and bake tonight

I'm the cruel harsh greedy tyrant
Cut heads of leviathan
Cook a dish for you
Be famished, addiction
Order my salvation
Relish the carnal vice

Listen
They are cheering
Foods sigh and keen
What a hearty feast I serve up

Listen
Obsession
Fascination
Overeat on my pasture
Never flee
Stay in your seats

Who's the cruel harsh greedy tyrant
Ruling the colossal kitchen
Force you live or die
No time for confession
Chopping board, destination
The same as a salmon fish

Listen
Fates are cheering
People sigh and keen
What a hearty feast we make up

Listen
Submission
Consolation
Never flee
Watch the lava bake Pompeii
Stay in your seats

Who's cheering
Foods sigh and keen
What a hearty feast we make up
