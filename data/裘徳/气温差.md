作词：黑金雨
作曲：裘德

Seventeen steps to a spring：
Fire, wintergreens
Fourteen snowy days
And you, the final key

Barefoot, tiptoe to me
I smell your scent of mead
Cannot help taking a tiny sip
Pardon my little greed

Hug and tickle
We laugh and fall
Heat duvets while it's so cold out

For now...I hope
This song finds you well
Through our pillow

Ice cream, Double scoop
Yours' cheese, mine's chocolate mousse
Would you like to have a taste
Why don't we kiss and exchange

I still wonder if I'm awake
Or just stay in a world being faked
I've been sinking in a snow globe, keeping drifting and dreaming
Dreaming...of you

Hug and tickle
We laugh and fall
Heat duvets while it's so cold out

For now...I hope
This song could be slower
Cause I need you so
Cause I miss you so
