作曲：裘德

A drop of your tear, a dew
Feelings remain, a few
Add in our lips, kissing lips - a test tube
We heat the tube
Shall we come and synthesize, or we decompose, our love?
Shall we fall and oxidize, or we do reduce, our love?

Till we see a residue
The ember and ash we pursue
Deep in our minds, wavering minds - overdue
All's overdue
Shall we hug and crystallize, or we redissolve, our love?
Shall I drop and vaporize, shed and liquefy, my love for you?

Oh...A scientific sway, (for my) hypothetic fay
Science can be a liar, may I pray?
Pathology, anatomy, how does your love start to decay?
How could you make my test go astray?

I will revenge my injuries； if I cannot inspire love， I will cause fear， and chiefly towards you my archenemy

Till we see a residue
The ember and ash we pursue
Deep in our minds, wavering minds - overdue
All's overdue
Shall we hug and crystallize, or we redissolve, our love?
Shall I initialize, my love for you?

Oh...A scientific sway, (for my) hypothetic fay
Science can be a liar, may I pray?
Pathology, anatomy, how does your love start to decay?
How could you make my test go astray?

And just quit as close a survey

Oh...A scientific sway, (for my) hypothetic fay
Science can be a liar, may I pray?
Pathology, anatomy, how does your love start to decay?
How could you make my test go astray?

Could I see through your heart by X-ray
