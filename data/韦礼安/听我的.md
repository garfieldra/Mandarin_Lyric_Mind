听我的你立地成佛
听我的你就没错
听我的因为我是我
Cause I just know

Been there done that
Now I'm back for more
I heard I saw
And I conquered all
Follow me follow me
Or you're gonna fall
Paved the way paved the way
I show them all

So bad so sad
But it's not your fault
I win everytime
And I win them all
I'm right I'm right
And I'm never wrong
You better shut up before your downfall

Hold your tongue now
Hold your heart now
Hear me talk cause
This is scripture

Don't make me, make you listen
This is gold and you're wasting your life away
Backtrack your nonsense
Backup I'm warnin'
Listen to me

Don't make me, make you listen
So behold Imma drop on you some wisdom
Ignorance's victim
I'm your only savior
Listen to me

听我的你立地成佛
听我的你就没错
听我的因为我是我
Cause I just know

Hold your tongue now
Hold your heart now
Hear me talk cause
This is scripture

Don't make me, make you listen
This is gold and you're wasting your life away
Backtrack your nonsense
Backup I'm warnin'
Listen to me

Don't make me, make you listen
So behold Imma drop on you some wisdom
Ignorance's victim
I'm your only savior
Listen to me

听我的你立地成佛
听我的你就没错
听我的因为我是我
Cause I just know
