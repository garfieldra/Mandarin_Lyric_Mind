Give me one lonely street in the dark and I'll find my way
Find the light in my heart rise above and go a little further
A silent glow forever
We will float like feathers
And as we go, go along, long this road
Passing people by
Like a leaf in the wind we will rise and we will fall again
A silent glow forever
We will float like feathers

Flying high forever
We will float like feathers
Till we've seen it all
Seen it all oh
Till we've seen it all
Oh we float like feathers

Reaching out falling free I can hear the whisper of my name
Like a seed underground growing in beautiful patterns
A silent glow forever
We will float like feathers

Flying high forever
We will float like feathers
Till we've seen it all
Seen it all oh
Till we've seen it all
Seen it all oh

Beautiful miracles
Everywhere along the way

Flying high forever
We will float like feathers
Till we've seen it all
Seen it all oh
Till we've seen it all
Seen it all oh
Oh
